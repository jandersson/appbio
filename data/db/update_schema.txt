-- How do you change the schema to add information about a protein's structure? 
-- You want to store the name for the structure (such as 2xkg, 5fvl, or 6eny, resolution (1.6Å, 1.97Å, or similar), 
-- and method ("Solution NMR", "X-ray diffraction"). Remember that a protein may have several structures published. 
-- Make your suggested changes and add some example data that you make up!
